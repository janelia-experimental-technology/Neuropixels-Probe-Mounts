# Neuropixels-Probe-Mounts

Neuropixels probes are next-generation electrodes that record the activity of hundreds of neurons in the brain. They were developed through a collaboration funded by Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Wellcome Trust, Gatsby Charitable Foundation, and Allen Institute for Brain Science. The head of the collaboration is Tim Harris at HHMI Janelia Research Campus, and the electrodes are designed and fabricated by IMEC, the nanoelectronics research center. Further details may be found in the Harris lab, the University College London, and the Neuropixels home. 

Among the most annoying, time-consuming, and risky tasks when using these and similar Si probes is mounting the probe to a stereotaxic rod or a head post attached to a stereotaxic rod.  The dimensional accuracy of Neuropixels offers the opportunity to use the base as a mounting reference. To facilitate this, the latest versions of Neuropixels now ship with integrated dovetail mounting fixtures.  The fixture orients to the “metal cap,” actually a dovetail mounting adapter.

The technologies offered here are the accessories for mounting these probes and the mounting rod to dovetail adapter for several versions of these probes. These accessories were designed at HHMI's Janelia Research Campus by the Janelia Experimental Technologies group in collaboration with IMEC and end users. The first generation of Neuropixels, 1.0, had a prototype (3A) and production (3B) version. Designs for these versions include the probe holder or mounting rod, the dovetail mount, and the dovetail extension.  We also make available the accessories and assembly for Neuropixels 2.0, including the probe holder/mounting rod, dovetail mount, rod adapter, and assembly instructions. PDF and CAD files are included for convenience.

Opportunity:

The Neuropixels Probe Mount for the prototype 3A and production 3B probe designs for Neuropixels 1.0 and the Neuropixels Probe Mount for Neuropixels 2.0 can be obtained for free in this repository. The designs were originally posted on the Flintbox and other pages linked below:

Neuropixels Technology Ready for Release


Advantages: These accessories allow use of probes that did not originally ship with integrated dovetail mounting features. 

Construction: See the individual part drawings for more detail on fabricating each part. See the attached assembly models for the purchased commercial items needed to complete each probe assembly.
